# Triangle
This repository holds and maintains variations of Jonathan Shewchuk's [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html). A tool for generating 2D meshes and triangulations. Information can be found at the Triangle webpage or in the source files and README for each directory.

## Original
This directory contains an unmodified copy of the original the files hosted [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html).

## MSVC
This directory contains a modified triangle.c for compatibility with the Microsoft C compiler. The README is updated to explicitly state the modifications and the steps to compile the tool as both an executable and a static libarary.
